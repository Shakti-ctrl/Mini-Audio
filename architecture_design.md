### 2. Flask Application (`app.py`)

*   **Initialization:** Set up Flask app, secret key, and load configurations.
*   **Authentication:** Implement the existing login/logout functionality, possibly moving user credentials to `config.py` or environment variables.
*   **Routing:**
    *   `/`: Main dashboard with two tabs: 'Audio Extractor' and 'Telegram Extractor/Forwarder'.
    *   Routes for audio-related operations (search YouTube, extract, upload local, play, download, download zip).
    *   Routes for Telegram-related operations (search channel, list messages, forward, download media).
    *   `/log`: Endpoint to fetch real-time logs.
*   **Asynchronous Tasks:** Continue using `threading.Thread` for long-running operations (YouTube downloads, audio extraction, Telegram message fetching/forwarding) to keep the Flask server responsive. For `telethon`'s `asyncio` nature, we'll need to run its async functions within a separate thread using `asyncio.run()` or similar.

### 3. Configuration (`config.py`)

*   `SECRET_KEY`
*   `WORK_DIR`, `AUDIO_DIR`, `TMP_DIR`, `UPLOAD_DIR`, `JSON_CACHE`, `LOG_FILE`
*   `USERS` (for authentication)
*   Telegram `API_ID`, `API_HASH`
*   Default `CHANNEL_URL`

### 4. Utility Functions (`utils.py`)

*   `log(msg)`: Centralized logging function.
*   Helper functions for file path management.

### 5. Audio Module (`audio_module.py`)

*   Encapsulate all audio extraction related functions:
    *   `search_youtube_channel(channel_url)`
    *   `download_and_extract_audio(video_ids, bot_token, chat_id)` (will be modified to use `telethon` for forwarding)
    *   `extract_audio_from_file(filepath)`
    *   `send_uploaded_file_to_bot(path, bot_token, chat_id)` (will be modified to use `telethon`)
    *   `get_audio_files()`
    *   `create_zip_archive(files)`

### 6. Telegram Module (`telegram_module.py`)

*   Encapsulate all Telegram interaction logic using `telethon`:
    *   `initialize_telegram_client(api_id, api_hash, session_name)`
    *   `get_channel_messages(channel_url, min_id=0, filters=None)`: Function to fetch messages from a Telegram channel, supporting filters (e.g., by type: text, photo, video, document).
    *   `forward_selected_messages(message_ids, source_channel, target_entity)`
    *   `download_telegram_media(message_id, path)`
    *   `join_chat_invite(invite_link)`
    *   Handle `FloodWaitError` and `MessageIdInvalidError` internally.
    *   `save_last_id`, `load_last_id` for progress tracking.

### 7. User Interface (`templates/index.html`)

*   Use a tabbed interface (e.g., using Bootstrap or simple CSS/JS) to switch between 'Audio Extractor' and 'Telegram Extractor/Forwarder'.
*   Each tab will have its own form elements and display areas.
*   Common elements like status bar, progress bar, and log display will be shared.
*   JavaScript will handle tab switching, dynamic content loading (e.g., video/message lists), and real-time log updates.

### 8. Data Flow

*   User interacts with the Flask UI.
*   Flask routes call functions in `audio_module.py` or `telegram_module.py`.
*   Long-running tasks are offloaded to separate threads.
*   Results (e.g., extracted audio paths, Telegram message lists) are returned to Flask and rendered in the UI.
*   Logs are written via `utils.log` and displayed in the UI.

### 9. Dependencies

*   `Flask`
*   `telethon`
*   `yt-dlp` (shell command)
*   `ffmpeg` (shell command)
*   `python-magic` (for file type detection in Telegram module, if needed for filtering)
*   `asyncio` (built-in, but needs careful handling with `threading`)

This architecture aims to keep the code modular, maintainable, and scalable, while addressing the asynchronous nature of `telethon` and providing a unified user experience.



### Combining Functionalities

To combine the functionalities, the core idea is to create a single Flask application (`app.py`) that acts as the central orchestrator. It will handle HTTP requests, manage sessions, and render the main HTML template. The specific logic for audio extraction and Telegram interaction will be modularized into `audio_module.py` and `telegram_module.py` respectively.

**Key Combination Strategies:**

1.  **Shared Flask Instance:** Both modules will operate under the same Flask application instance. This means `app = Flask(__name__)` will be defined once in `app.py`, and other modules will import `app` as needed (e.g., for registering blueprints or accessing `app.config`).

2.  **Unified Routing:** All routes (e.g., `/`, `/log`, `/play`, `/download`, `/telegram_search`, `/telegram_forward`) will be defined within `app.py` or registered as blueprints from the respective modules. This ensures a single entry point for all web interactions.

3.  **Centralized Configuration:** A `config.py` file will store all application-wide settings, including directory paths, secret keys, and Telegram API credentials. This promotes consistency and ease of management.

4.  **Common Utilities:** Functions like `log()` will be moved to `utils.py` and imported by all modules that need to write to the application log. This centralizes logging and ensures a consistent format.

5.  **Asynchronous Task Management:** Since both the audio extraction (yt-dlp, ffmpeg) and Telegram operations (telethon) can be long-running, they will continue to be executed in separate threads. The `threading.Thread` approach used in the audio extractor is suitable. For `telethon`'s `asyncio` nature, `asyncio.run()` will be used within these threads to execute asynchronous `telethon` functions synchronously from the thread's perspective.

6.  **Inter-module Communication:** While the modules are largely independent in their core logic, the Telegram forwarding functionality in the original audio extractor will be re-implemented using `telegram_module.py`'s `telethon` capabilities. This means `audio_module.py` will call functions in `telegram_module.py` for forwarding tasks, rather than using `curl` directly.

7.  **Shared UI Elements:** The status bar, progress bar, and log display will be universal elements on the main page, updated by JavaScript based on the activities in either the audio or Telegram sections.

This approach ensures that the application remains cohesive while allowing for clear separation of concerns between the audio and Telegram functionalities.



### Unified User Interface (UI) Design

The UI will be a single HTML page (`templates/index.html`) utilizing a tabbed interface to switch between the Audio Extractor and Telegram Extractor/Forwarder functionalities. This provides a clean and organized user experience.

**Key UI Elements:**

*   **Navigation Tabs:** Two prominent tabs at the top: "Audio Extractor" and "Telegram Extractor/Forwarder". Clicking a tab will reveal its corresponding content area.
*   **Shared Header:** A common header for the application title and potentially the login/logout links.
*   **Status Bar & Progress Bar:** A single status bar (`#statusBar`) and progress bar (`#progressBar`) will be present at the top of the page, visible regardless of the active tab. These will provide real-time feedback on ongoing operations (e.g., "Searching videos...", "Forwarding messages...").
*   **Log Output:** A single log display area (`#logbox`) will show all application logs, consolidating output from both audio and Telegram operations.

**Audio Extractor Tab Content:**

*   Input for YouTube channel URL.
*   Buttons for "Search" and "Extract".
*   List of videos with checkboxes for selection, thumbnails, and titles.
*   Section for "Your Extracted Audio Files" with play, download, and ZIP download options.
*   Form for "Upload Local Video and Extract Audio".
*   Form for "Upload Any File to Telegram Bot" (this will be re-routed to use the `telethon` based Telegram module).

**Telegram Extractor/Forwarder Tab Content:**

*   Input for Telegram channel/group URL or username.
*   Input for `api_id` and `api_hash` (and potentially bot token/chat ID if direct bot actions are exposed).
*   Buttons for "Search Channel" (to list messages) and "Forward Selected".
*   List of messages with checkboxes for selection. Each message entry should display relevant information (e.g., sender, date, message type, snippet of text/file name).
*   **New Features (similar to Audio Extractor):**
    *   "Select All" checkbox for messages.
    *   Filtering options for messages (e.g., by type: text, photo, video, document; by keywords; by sender).
    *   Option to download selected media/files from Telegram messages.
*   Progress display specific to Telegram operations.

### Common Components Identification

Several components and functionalities can be shared or centralized across the application to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.

1.  **Authentication System:** The existing Flask login/logout mechanism will be used for the entire application. User credentials will be managed centrally.

2.  **Directory Structure & File Paths:** All `WORK_DIR`, `AUDIO_DIR`, `TMP_DIR`, `UPLOAD_DIR`, `JSON_CACHE`, `LOG_FILE` definitions will be moved to `config.py` and accessed globally. This ensures consistent file management.

3.  **Logging:** The `log()` function will be moved to `utils.py` and used by both `audio_module.py` and `telegram_module.py` to write to the same `LOG_FILE`. The `/log` endpoint will serve this unified log.

4.  **Asynchronous Task Execution:** The pattern of using `threading.Thread` for background tasks will be applied consistently to both audio and Telegram operations. This ensures the Flask main thread remains free to handle requests.

5.  **Error Handling:** A consistent approach to error handling and user feedback will be implemented across both modules. This includes displaying error messages in the status bar or log.

6.  **Frontend JavaScript:** A single JavaScript file (e.g., `static/js/main.js`) will handle UI interactions, tab switching logic, dynamic content updates (fetching video/message lists via AJAX), and real-time log updates. Functions like `selectAll()` will be generalized to work for both video and message lists.

By centralizing these common components, the development process will be more efficient, and the final application will be more robust and easier to manage.
